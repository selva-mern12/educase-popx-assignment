## 📋 Notes

- All inputs use `onClick` handlers for form logic (not `onSubmit`) per assignment restriction.
- Responsive only up to `max-width: 400px` to simulate mobile screen dimensions.
- Transitions and animations added using Tailwind's `animate-*` utilities.
- Uses `className` instead of `class` in JSX as required.
